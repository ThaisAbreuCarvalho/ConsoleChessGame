<h1>XadrezDeConsole
</h1>
 <p>This project is just initially created, having the objective of exercising OOP principles and having some fun!</p>
 <p>The initial thought is to build a chess game played through the console and maybe in the future add some graphic interfaces</p>
 <p>At the master branch you can have fun moving pieces and playing, rules are being developed at DEV_001 </p>
 <p>You're welcome to contribute if you want to, just create a branch from de development one... :wink:</p>
