<h1>XadrezDeConsole</h1>
<div>
 <p>This project is just initially created, having the objective of exercising OOP principles and having some fun!</p>
 <p>The initial thought is to build a chess game played through the console and maybe in the future add some graphic interfaces</p>
 <p>At the master branch you can have fun moving pieces and playing, movimentation rules have just been updated, so now we move according to the rules! </p>
 <p>shifting turns among special moves and others are still being developed</p>
 <p>You're welcome to contribute if you want to, just create a branch from de development one... :wink:</p>

- The rules found in http://www.fraserheightschess.com/Documents/BasicChessRules.pdf are under implementation
